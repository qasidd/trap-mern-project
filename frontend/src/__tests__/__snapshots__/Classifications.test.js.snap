        Before they are released to the public, all films are given age ratings by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). These categorisations are made to help children and families choose what is right for them and what to avoid.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are five main ratings that the BBFC give out: U, PG, 12, 15 and 18.

                General viewing, but some scenes may be unsuitable for young children. A 
 PG film should not unsettle a child aged around eight or older. Unaccompanied 
 children of any age may watch, but parents are advised to consider whether the content 
 may upset younger, or more sensitive, children.

                No detail of potentially dangerous behaviour which young children are likely to copy, if that behaviour is presented as safe or fun. No glamorisation of realistic or easily accessible weapons such as knives. No focus on anti-social behaviour which young children are likely to copy.

                Discriminatory language or behaviour is unlikely to be acceptable unless clearly disapproved of, or in an educational or historical context, or in a particularly dated work with no likely appeal to children.

              <p>
                Drug taking may be shown but the work as a whole must not promote or encourage drug misuse (for example, through detailed instruction). The misuse of easily accessible and highly dangerous substances (for example, aerosols or solvents) is unlikely to be acceptable.

              <p>
                There may be strong language. Very strong language may be permitted, depending on the manner in which it is used, who is using the language, its frequency within the work as a whole and any special contextual justification.

              </h5>
              <p>
                There are no constraints on nudity in a non-sexual or educational context. Sexual nudity may be permitted but strong detail is likely to be brief or presented in a comic context.
              </p>

              <p>
                Sexual activity may be portrayed, but usually without strong detail. There may be strong verbal references to sexual behaviour. Repeated very strong references, particularly those using pornographic language, are unlikely to be acceptable. Works whose primary purpose is sexual arousal are unacceptable.

              </h5>
              <p>
                There may be strong verbal references to sexual violence but any depiction of the stronger forms of sexual violence, including rape, must not be detailed or prolonged. A strong and sustained focus on sexual threat is unacceptable.
              </p>
              <h5>
                <em>
                  Threat and horror
                </em>
              </h5>
              <p>
                There may be strong threat and horror. A sustained focus on sadistic threat is unlikely to be acceptable.
              </p>
              <h5>
                <em>

              </h5>
              <p>
                Violence may be strong but should not dwell on the infliction of pain or injury. The strongest gory images are unlikely to be acceptable. Strong sadistic violence is also unlikely to be acceptable.

                <li>
                  where the material is in breach of the criminal law, or has been created through the commission of a criminal offence
                </li>
                <li>
                  where material or treatment appears to us to risk harm to individuals or, through their behaviour, to society. For example, the detailed portrayal of violent or dangerous acts, or of illegal drug use, which may cause harm to public health or morals. This may include portrayals of sadistic violence, rape or other non-consensual sexually violent behaviour which make this violence look appealing; reinforce the suggestion that victims enjoy rape or other non-consensual sexually violent behaviour; or which invite viewer complicity in rape, other non-consensual sexually violent behaviour or other harmful violent activities
