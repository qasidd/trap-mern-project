# Cinema Web Application Project 

## Project Description
This repository is to show the development and creation of an advance website application for a selected cinema franchise, using the full MERN stack principle. Which involves the use of: **Mongo DB**, **Express**, **React** and **Node.JS**. The frontend of the application will be built using React with CSS styling, while the backend will be built using Mongo/Mongoose, Express and Node. The functionality of our code is tested using **Chai**, **Istanbul** and **Mocha**. To determine if we reach test coverage that is ideal for industry standards. Overall, this README file will give you the neccessary information to obtain a working version of this application on your local machine. 

### Test Coverage: 
~


## Aim Of The Project
 * As a team creating a full stack website application using MERN and other methods that were taught to us during our time at QA Academy. 
 * Using a specification given to use by a client highlight the **Minimum Value Product(MVP)** which will help in the design of the website. 
 * Use wireframe.cc to plan the website pages. 
 * Work in agile mindset when developing the website.

## Further Contribution
Please feel free to contribute by adding new features to this project:

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/qasidd/trap-mern-project>)
2. Create a new feature branch, remember to branch out of master/main (`git checkout -b <new feature branch name>`)
3. Add these changes to your staging area (`git add .`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add something'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin <feature branch name>`)
6. Create a new Pull Request

## Deployment/Running The Application
As mention before the backend is written using Node.js and Express with some intergation from Mongo DB. Before running the whole application make sure the backend is connected to Mongo database. 

**To run the backend:**

```bash
-cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

*Note:* 
- *The application will open on a new server port i.e. http://localhost:3000/*
- *It is crucial to use the command `npm install` or `npm i` to have all the node modules, package-lock.json and package.json files added to the local machine*

Most of the frontend is built using React with CSS and other packages such as reactstrap. 

**To run the frontend:**

```bash
-cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

*Note:* 
- *The application will open on a new server port i.e. http://localhost:3001/*
- *It is crucial to use the command `npm install` or `npm i` to have all the node modules, package-lock.json and package.json files added to the local machine*
