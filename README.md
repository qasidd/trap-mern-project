# Cinema Web Application Project 

## Project Description
This repository is to show the development and creation of an advance website application for a selected cinema franchise, using the full MERN stack principle. Which involves the use of: **Mongo DB**, **Express**, **React** and **Node.JS**. The frontend of the application will be built using React with CSS styling, while the backend will be built using Mongo/Mongoose, Express and Node. The functionality of our code is tested using **Chai**, **Istanbul** and **Mocha**. To determine if we reach test coverage that is ideal for industry standards. Overall, this README file will give you the neccessary information to obtain a working version of this application on your local machine.
